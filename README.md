Dunkirk
========

A special pitch shifting algorithm where going up/down a whole number of octaves amounts to doing nothing â€” allowing for infinite pitch shifting.

Usage
------

Head up to the [online Faust IDE](https://faustide.grame.fr/) and copy-paste `dunkirk.dsp`.

From there, you can test the algorithm in real time (click *Run*) or create a VST and many more (click the small truck).
